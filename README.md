### Python Tweet Bot for Twitter

This tweet bot utilizes multiple packages like environ, tweepy and time to create a simple tweet bot that tweet vocabularies from a list of text. It is not used for anything else besides tweeting. This bot was then deployed through Heroku (an online cloud platform). 

Include in this tweet bot is the retweeting function that will automatically retweet #WordOfTheDay tweets from multiple sources across Twitter, including Merriam Webster, OED and Thesaurus.com. 

Update: a new feature (the reply bot) is also tested in this time being. Simply tag the bot and a word behind it to find the definition of the word. Currently process 1 request per day due to the low demand.
